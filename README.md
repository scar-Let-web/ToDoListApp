# To-Do List Application (Java Sweng)

This project is a **Java Swing-based To-Do List application** developed to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, GUI development, and basic file persistence.

The application allows users to create, categorize, prioritize, update, and persist tasks across sessions.

## Features

- Add tasks with:
  - Title
  - Category (Academic, Personal, Career)
  - Priority level
- Update task status:
  - Not Started
  - In Progress
  - Done
- Delete tasks
- Automatic sorting by priority
- Category-based task organization using tabs
- Persistent storage using a local text file (`tasks.txt`)
- User-friendly GUI built with Java Swing
